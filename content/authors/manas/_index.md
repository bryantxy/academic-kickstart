I'm a 2nd year MS CS student at Georgia Tech. I'm advised by [Prof. Alexey Tumanov](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~atumanov/) in the Systems for Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL), working on democratizing machine learning through better frameworks, tools, and algorithms.

In Summer 2020, I interned at [Nvidia with the TensorRT team](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt), optimizing systems for deep-learning inference on GPUs.

Prior to starting at Georgia Tech, I was an ML Software Engineer at Samsung R&D, India helping enable flagship vision applications through the [Samsung Neural SDK](https://developer.samsung.com/neural/overview.html) and completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics & Computing at Delhi Technological University.
