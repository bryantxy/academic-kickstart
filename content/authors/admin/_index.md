I'm a CS Masters student at Georgia Tech, and a Mathematics & Computing graduate from Delhi College of Engineering.

From 2017-2019, I was a Sotfware Engineer at Samsung Research - Bangalore, where I worked on the intersection of machine learning & systems, to make heavy neural networks run efficiently on low-power devices.

I like to learn new things & explain them, and talk peopleâ€™s ears off about work I find interesting.
